# Quantum Navigation System 🚀

## Overview
The **Quantum Navigation System (QNS)** is an advanced AI-powered navigation platform that integrates **Quantum Computing, Blockchain, and AI** to provide real-time traffic predictions, secure route optimization, and decentralized navigation services.

## Features
- 🌍 **Quantum AI for Traffic Prediction** – Predicts congestion before it happens.
- 🛰 **Real-Time Satellite Imaging** – Uses satellite feeds for live road analysis.
- 🔐 **Blockchain for Data Security** – Ensures encrypted and decentralized navigation data.
- 🚗 **Vehicle Proximity Detection** – Alerts drivers of nearby vehicles and blind spots.
- 🌦 **Weather-Based Route Adjustments** – Adapts navigation based on real-time weather changes.
- 📡 **Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Navigation** – Eliminates reliance on central servers.
